# PRODIGY_CS_01 — Caesar Cipher GUI 🔐

This project is developed as part of my **Prodigy InfoTech - Cyber Security Internship (Task 01)**.

It demonstrates encryption and decryption using the **Caesar Cipher algorithm** with a user-friendly **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built using Python Tkinter.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Encrypts and decrypts messages using Caesar Cipher
- Simple and clean user interface
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase alphabets
- Handles spaces, numbers, and special characters safely
- Provides error alerts for invalid inputs

## 🧠 What is Caesar Cipher?

Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest encryption techniques used in cryptography.

It shifts each character of the plaintext by a certain number of positions:

Example with a shift value = 3:HELLO → KHOOR

Decryption shifts back:KHOOR → HELLO
